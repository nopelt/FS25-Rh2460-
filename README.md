# FS25-Rh2460Plus  


This mod enhances the original RH2460 belt system to process carrots, parsnips, and red beets, converting them into pallets just as it originally does with potatoes.  
The original `fillable` pallet was replaced with a `vegetable` pallet because it looks more realistic.  
The height of the RH2460 was also adjusted to be slightly taller, allowing pallets to fit underneath more easily.  



Here are some images showcasing the changes:
